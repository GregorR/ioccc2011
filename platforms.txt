Shown is the exact compiler version tested. All tests are on GNU/Linux unless
specified otherwise, though the OS is mostly irrelevant. I expect things to
generally work with other versions of the compilers, but show only the tested
version for honesty sake.

Platforms on which all known/tested optimization levels work with no additional
flags:
 * gcc 4.6.2 + x86[_64]
 * clang 2.9-16 + x86[_64]
 * gcc 4.4.5 + alpha, arm, mips[el], powerpc[64], s390x (IBM zSeries)
 * gcc 4.1.3 + vax + NetBSD

Platforms which work but not at all optimization levels or needing special
flags:
owcc 1.9 + x86 + Windows:
    Needs -fno-stack-check

gcc 4.4.5 + sh4:
    -O0 works
    Higher optimization levels don't work for unknown reasons.
