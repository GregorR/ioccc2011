Debug in this order:

nothing.jch: Should be an infinite loop with no output. This tests function pro/epilogues.
loop.jch: Loops through the ASCII character set infinitely. Tests + and . (kinda) without testing jumps.
abc.jch: Tests everything but getchar, one at a time so it's easy to figure out what's broken.
hello.jch: Tests everything in a "real" program
cat repl.jch hello.jch gorepl.jch: Everything plus circularity.
